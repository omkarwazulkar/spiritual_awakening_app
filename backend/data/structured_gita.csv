18.8,Krishna,दखमतयव यतकरम कयकलशभयततयजत स कतव रजस तयग नव तयगफल लभत,he who renounces acts that are painful out of fear of bodily suffering performs a rajasika abandonment however he does not gain the fruit of such abandonment,whatever action one may relinquish merely as being painful out of fear of physical suffering he having resorted to renunciation based on rajas will surely not acquire the fruits of renunciation,he who abandons action out of fear of bodily trouble because it is painful does not obtain the merit of renunciation by performing such rajasic renunciation,he who would out of fear of bodily exertion relinquish an action just because it is painfulthat person having thus made relinquishment an act of the rajas strand would not at all gain the fruit of that relinquishment,to avoid an action out of fear of physical suffering as it is likely to be painful is to act out of passion and the benefit of renunciation will not be gained
18.9,Krishna,करयमतयव यतकरम नयत करयतऽरजन सङग तयकतव फल चव स तयग सततवक मत,when actions are performed as they ought to be done o arjuna renouncing attachment and the results thereof such abandonment is regarded as sattvika,whatever obligatory duty is performed just because it is a bounden duty o arjuna by giving up attachment and the results as wellthat renunciation is considered to be based on sattva,whatever obligatory action is done o arjuna merely because it ought to be done abandoning attachment and also the desire for reward that renunciation is regarded as sattvic pure,this is a thing to be performed just on that ground whatever usual action is performed relinquishing attachment and also fruit that act of relinquishment is deemed to be of the sattva strand,he who performs an obligatory action believing it to be a duty that ought to be done without any personal desire to do the act or to receive any returnsuch renunciation is pure
18.10,Krishna,न दवषटयकशल करम कशल ननषजजत तयग सततवसमवषट मधव छननसशय,one who has abandoned imbued with sattva wise and whose doubts have been dispelledsuch a person neither hates disagreeable acts nor clings to agreeable ones,the man of renunciation imbued with sattva wise and free from doubts does not hate unbecoming action nor does he become attached to becoming activity,the man of renunciation pervaded by purity intelligent and with his doubts cut asunder does not hate an unpleasant task nor is he attached to a pleasant one,the man of renunciation who is wellpossessed of sattva is wise and has his doubts destroyedhe does not hate unskilled action and does not cling to skilled action,the wise man who has attained purity whose doubts are resolved who is filled with the spirit of selfabnegation does not shy away from action due to its pain nor does he crave it due to its pleasure

18.16,Krishna,ततरव सत करतरमतमन कवल त य पशयतयकतबदधतवनन स पशयत दरमत,therefore he who due to his uncultivated understanding perceives only the self as the agent he of wicked mind does not truly perceive,therefore anyone whose intellect is imperfect and perceives the absolute self as the agent does not perceive properly and has a distorted intellect,now such being the case verily he who owing to an untrained understanding looks upon his self which is isolated as the agent he of perverted intelligence does not see,but this being the case whoever views himself as the sole agent due to their imperfect intellectthey the defectiveminded ones do not view things rightly,but the fool who due to his immature judgment supposes that it is his own self alone that acts perverts the truth and does not see rightly
